nRF Chips
=========

This is a dedicated space for nRF chips. Since I'm recently working with them extensively, I expect the number of articles will grow rapidly. In order to maintain the sidebar clean, all articles related to nRF devices will be placed here.

While working on the articles, I'm using the `nRF52840 DK <https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dk>`_ development board. It's pretty cheap and versatile board with a powerful chip. I really recommend buying it to whoever wants to start learning nRF ecosystem.
